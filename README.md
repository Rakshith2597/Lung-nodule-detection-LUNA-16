# Lung-nodule-detection-LUNA-16

This Github repository,has the code used as part of my Bachelor's in technology main-project. The purpose of this code is to detect nodules in a CT scan of lung and subsequently to classify them as being benign, malignant. 

Abstract:

Abstractâ€”Lung cancer is one of the leading cause for cancer related death in the world. Early detection of the tumor is
a crucial part of giving patients the best chance of recovery. However, analysis and cure of lung malignancy have been one
of the greatest difficulties faced by humans over the most recent couple of decades. Deep learning gives us to increase the
accuracy of the automated initial diagnosis. This project uses an approach that utilizes a network with features of U-Net architecture to classify cancer nodules as benign or malignant with an accuracy of 92.38 and a low percentage of false positives(<10%).

Dataset used: LUNA 16

Trained model and results have not been uploaded in the repo due to its size.

Front-end of the CAD system is in the repo mentioned below.
